# BlazorASPNETCoreTailwindCSS
This a sample Blazor ASP.NET Core application with Tailwind CSS Support using Grunt. I was experimenting with ASP.NET Core and wondered if I could use Tailwind CSS to replace the default static Bootstrap CSS configuration.

The code in this repo is explained in article [Tailwind CSS In Blazor ASP.NET Core App With Grunt](https://medium.com/@georgemr/tailwind-css-in-blazor-asp-net-core-app-with-grunt-24a627cd9f3a).
